# 📊 Blinkit Sales Data Analysis

# 📌 **Project Overview**

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Blinkit sales data using Python.
The goal of the project is to analyze product sales, identify patterns, understand correlations between features, and generate business insights from the dataset.

# 🛠️ **Tools & Libraries Used**

1.Python

2.Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

3.Matplotlib → Data visualization

4. Seaborn → Advanced visualizations (barplots, histograms, heatmaps)

# 🔑 **Key Steps in Analysis**

1.Data Cleaning

2.Handled missing values

3.Checked data types

4.Removed/handled inconsistencies

5.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

6.Distribution of sales across different product categories

7.Impact of visibility, outlet type, and location on sales

8.Sales trend analysis

9.Correlation Heatmap (Added Feature)

10.Generated a heatmap to check relationships between numerical features such as sales, item visibility, and item weight

# **Insights & Observations**

1.Certain outlet types perform significantly better in sales

2.Location and visibility impact item sales

3.Weak but noticeable correlations between numerical features

 # 📷 **Sample Visualizations**

Sales distribution plots

Category-wise sales bar charts

Correlation heatmap
